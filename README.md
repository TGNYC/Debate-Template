# Debate Template
Debate Template is a Google Docs add-on that allows for easier debating using Google Docs or a Chromebook. 

### Installation

Go to the Chrome Webstore and install the [Debate Template Add-On](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/debate-template/ppcepmehdghpcbakboahipbhknhncnoh)



### Usage

**Key Features**

- Header commands (Pocket, Hat, Block, Tag)
- Card cutting commands (Cite, Emphasis, Highlight, Clear, Shrink, Condense)
- Speech control commands (Open, New, Send to Speech)
- Built in Debate Timer with presets
- Full Screen mode (View => Full Screen) enables "viewing" mode where cards can be marked and the up and down arrow keys function as page up and page down keys



**Important Usage Notes**

- To use this add-on, you have to have an internet connection.  Not all tournaments have wifi, so be ready to use a hot spot.  If you enable offline editing, you will still have access to your files.
- Google Docs starts to have problems with really large files.  So your 1000 page impact defense file might take a long time to load.  Consider splitting files into several smaller files.
- Google Docs cannot edit Word docs, so you cannot use the add-on with your Word files directly.  Google Docs allows you to make a Google Doc version of the file, which you can then edit with the add-on.
